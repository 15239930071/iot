# RegisterDevice {#reference_pc2_kpz_wdb .reference}

Call this operation to register a device.

## Description {#section_r5z_4wf_xdb .section}

Registering a device means creating a device for a product. After a device is successfully registered, Alibaba Cloud IoT Platform issues a globally unique ID \(IotId\) for the device. When you perform operations related to the device, you can provide the IotId to identify the device.

**Note:** Besides IotId, you also can use the combination of ProductKey and DeviceName to identity a device. ProductKey is the identifier that IoT Platform issues for a product when it is created, and DeviceName is the device name that either you specify or the system randomly generates when the device is registered. The priority of IotId is higher than the combination of ProductKey and DeviceName.

-   If you want to register multiple devices for a product at a time and have the device names randomly generated by the system, you can call the BatchRegisterDevice operation. See [BatchRegisterDevice](reseller.en-US/Developer Guide (Cloud)/API reference/Manage devices/BatchRegisterDevice.md#).
-   If you want to register multiple devices with specified names, firstly, call BatchCheckDeviceNames to register names for the devices that you want to register and generate an application ID \(ApplyId\), and then call BatchRegisterDeviceWithApplyId to register devices. See [BatchCheckDeviceNames](reseller.en-US/Developer Guide (Cloud)/API reference/Manage devices/BatchCheckDeviceNames.md#) and [BatchRegisterDeviceWithApplyId](reseller.en-US/Developer Guide (Cloud)/API reference/Manage devices/BatchRegisterDeviceWithApplyId.md#).

## Request parameters {#section_fkk_fyf_xdb .section}

|Parameter|Type|Required|Description|
|:--------|:---|:-------|:----------|
|Action|String|Yes|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to RegisterDevice.|
|ProductKey|String|Yes|The identifier of the product to which the device to be registered belongs.|
