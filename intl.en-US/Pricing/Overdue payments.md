# Overdue payments {#concept_zc5_jx1_5db .concept}

A bill is issued within four hours starting from the end of the current billing cycle.

If payment for the bill is received within 24 hours, your service will not be affected. If payment for the bill is not received within 24 hours, your service will be suspended automatically. We recommend that you pay all overdue bills within 24 hours to avoid any service interruption.

If service is suspended due to an overdue bill that exceeds the 24 hour grace period, you can continue using your service by reloading your account balance.
