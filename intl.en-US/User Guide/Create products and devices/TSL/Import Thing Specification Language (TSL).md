# Import Thing Specification Language \(TSL\) {#task_y4y_kqj_w2b .task}

This article introduces how to import an existing TSL for a product.

1.  Log on to the [IoT Platform console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/iot).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Devices** \> **Product**.
3.  On the Products page, find the product for which you want to import TSL and click **View**.
4.  Click **Define Feature** \> **Import TSL**. 

    **Note:** 

    -   The previously defined features of the product will be overwritten, once you have imported a new TSL for the product. Therefore, this function must be used with caution.
    -   You cannot import a TSL for a product whose gateway connection protocol is defined as Modbus.

    You can import TSL in two ways:

    -   **Copy Product**: Copy the TSL of another product. Select an existing product and click **OK** to import the TSL of the selected product to this product.

        If you want to modify some features, click **Edit** corresponding to the features on the Define Feature tab page.

    -   **Import TSL**: Paste your self-defined TSL script into the edit box and click **OK**.

        The size of the imported file cannot exceed 64 KB.
