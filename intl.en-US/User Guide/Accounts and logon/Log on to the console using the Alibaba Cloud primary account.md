## Create access control using the primary account {#section_ypn_4bx_5db .section}

The primary account has full permissions, so the leakage of the primary account may cause serious security risks. Therefore, do not disclose your Alibaba Cloud account and password when you authorize others to access your Alibaba Cloud resources. Instead, you should use Resource Access ManagementÂ \(RAM\) to create sub-accounts and assign the required access permissions to these sub-accounts. All users except the primary account user or administrator access the resources using sub-accounts. For more information about accessing IoT Platform using RAM users, see[Use RAM users](intl.en-US/User Guide/Accounts and logon/Resource Access Management (RAM)/Use RAM users.md#) and [Custom permissions](intl.en-US/User Guide/Accounts and logon/Resource Access Management (RAM)/Custom permissions.md#).
