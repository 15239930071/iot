# M2M communication {#concept_att_dh1_ydb .concept}

Machine-to-Machine \(M2M\) is a kind of end-to-end communication. This section describes how to build an M2M communication architecture in IoT Platform by using the data forwarding feature of the rules engine or the topic-based message routing service. A connection between a smart lamp and a mobile app is used as an example.

IoT Platform handles communication requests between the device and the app, allowing you to focus on implementing your business system. This frees you from worries about technical issues such as guaranteeing a high level of stable communication in high-concurrency scenarios or maintaining expensive servers to handle requests.
