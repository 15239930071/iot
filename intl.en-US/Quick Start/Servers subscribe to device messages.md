# Servers subscribe to device messages {#task_xy5_wk2_vdb .task}

When devices are connected to IoT Platform, they report data to the platform. Data in the platform can be pushed to your server through a HTTP/2 channel. Set the service subscription through HTTP/2 and configure for HTTP/2 SDKs. You can then connect your server to an HTTP/2 SDK and the server can receive device data.

![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/17309/15547364628965_en-US.png)

1.  You configure service subscription for your products in the [IoT Platform console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/iot). 
    1.  On the Products page, find the product for which you want to configure the service subscription and click **View**. 
    2.  On the product details page, click **Service Subscription**, and then click **Set**. 
    3.  Select the types of notifications which you want to push to your server \(HTTP/2 SDK\) and click **Save**. 

        |Message Type|Description|
        |:-----------|:----------|
        |Device Upstream Notification|Includes the custom data, property data, and event data that are reported by devices, responses to property setting requests, and responses to service callings.|
        |Device Status Change Notification|Indicates the notifications that are sent by the system when the statuses of devices change. For example, the notifications upon devices going online or going offline.|
        |Device Changes Throughout Lifecycle|Includes notifications about device creation, deletion, disabling, and enabling.|
        |Sub-Device Data Report Detected by Gateway|Gateways can report the information of sub-devices that are discovered locally. To use this feature, make sure that the applications on the gateway support this feature.|
        |Device Topological Relation Changes|Includes notifications about creation and removal of the topological relation between a gateway and its sub-devices.|

2.  Connect to the HTTP/2 SDK. If you use Apache Maven to manage Java projects, you add the following dependency content to the pom.xml file.

    **Note:** Currently, only SDKs in Java 8 are supported.

    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aliyun.openservices</groupId>
        <artifactId>iot-client-message</artifactId>
        <version>1.1.3</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aliyun</groupId>
        <artifactId>aliyun-java-sdk-core</artifactId>
        <version>3.7.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

3.  Connect the SDK and IoT Platform using the AccessKey information of your Alibaba Cloud account for identity authentication. 

    ```
    // Your AccessKey
            String accessKey = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
            // Your account AccessKeySecret
            String accessSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
            // Region ID of your IoT Platform service
            String regionId = "cn-shanghai";
            // Your account ID.
            String uid = "xxxxxxxxxxxx";
            // endPoint:  https://${uid}.iot-as-http2.${region}.aliyuncs.com
            String endPoint = "https://" + uid + ".iot-as-http2." + regionId + ".aliyuncs.com";
    
            // Connection configuration
            Profile profile = Profile.getAccessKeyProfile(endPoint, regionId, accessKey, accessSecret);
    
            // Construct the client
            MessageClient client = MessageClientFactory.messageClient(profile);
    
            // Receive data
            client.connect(messageToken -> {
                Message m = messageToken.getMessage();
                System.out.println("receive message from " + m);
                return MessageCallback.Action.CommitSuccess;
            });
    ```

    The parameters are introduced as follows:

    -   accessKey and accessSecret: Log on to the console, move the pointer to your account image, and click **AccessKey**. You are directed to the User Management page and you can create a new AccessKey or view the AccessKey ID and AccessKey Secret of an existing AccessKey on this page.
    -   uid: Log on to the console, move the pointer to your account image, and click **Security Settings**. You are directed to the Account Management page and you can view your account ID on this page.
    -   regionId: The region of your IoT Platform service. For information about RegionId expressions, see [Regions and zones](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/help/doc-detail/40654.htm).
4.  Test and make sure that the HTTP/2 SDK can successfully receive messages from devices. 

    If the message is successfully received, you can obtain the following data from the message callback of the SDK.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |:--------|:----------|
    |messageId|Message ID generated by IoT Platform .|
    |topic|The topic from which the message is sent. For example, `/a1wmrZPO8o9/cbgiotkJ4O4WW59ivysa/data`. If the message is a device status change notification, the topic format is `/as/mqtt/status/${productKey}/${deviceName}`.|
    |payload|The payload of the message.|
    |generateTime|The timestamp when the message is generated, in millisecond.|
    |qos|     -   0: The message is only pushed one time.
    -   1: The message is pushed at least one time.
