3.   Set the device name to SK-1. 

    **Note:** A device name uniquely identifies a device under a product and can be used to communicate with IoT Hub.Â 

4.   Click **OK**. 

    The Added page appears, as shown in [Figure 3](#fig_snz_td3_vdb).

5.   Click **Copy** to save the three key fields \(ProductKey, DeviceName, and DeviceSecret\) of the device. 

    The three key fields will be added to the device SDK and used for authentication when the device connects to IoT Platform.

    ```
    "product_key":"a1ekkixgSv1",
    "device_name":"SK-1",
    "device_secret":"Mqfov2L55E3IwTvy49ikhqs69FfQkScF",
    ```

    -   product\_key: Identifies a product category.
    -   device\_name: Identifies a device in a category.
    -   device\_secret: Device key.
6.   Click **Close**.
