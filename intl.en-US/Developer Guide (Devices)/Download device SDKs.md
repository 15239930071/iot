# Download device SDKs {#concept_jlk_mjl_vdb .concept}

IoT Platform provides multiple device SDKs to help you develop your devices and connect them to IoT Platform. If you want to develop your own SDK, see [Communications over Alink protocol](reseller.en-US/Developer Guide (Devices)/Develop devices based on Alink Protocol/Communications over Alink protocol.md#) for Alink data information.

## Prerequisites {#section_j13_sxr_52b .section}

Before you develop a device SDK, you must complete all console configurations and obtain all necessary information \(such as the device certificate information and topic information\). For details, see the User Guide.

## Use SDKs provided by IoT Platform {#section_e4x_yxr_52b .section}

You can use an SDK provided by IoT Platform and configure the SDK according to your business requirements and the protocol you want to use. For more information, see [Documents of Link Kit SDKs](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/product/93051.htm).

## Develop an SDK based on the Alink protocol {#section_uyv_bm1_mgb .section}

If you have specific development requirements that cannot be met by the provided SDKs, you can develop your own SDK. For Alink information, see [Alink protocol](reseller.en-US/Developer Guide (Devices)/Develop devices based on Alink Protocol/Communications over Alink protocol.md#).
