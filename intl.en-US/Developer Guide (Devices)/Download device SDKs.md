# Download device SDKs {#concept_jlk_mjl_vdb .concept}

IoT Platform provides multiple device SDKs to help you develop your devices and connect them to IoT Platform.

## Prerequisites {#section_j13_sxr_52b .section}

Before you develop a device SDK, you must complete all the required configurations in the IoT Platform console and obtain all necessary information \(such as the device certificate information and topic information\). For more information about console configurations, see the related documents in the User Guide.

## Device SDKs provided by IoT Platform {#section_e4x_yxr_52b .section}

You can install and configure an SDK provided by IoT Platform on your device, and then your device can connect to IoT Platform by using the SDK.

Download device SDK from [C SDK](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/96623.htm)

## Develop your own SDK based on the Alink protocol {#section_uyv_bm1_mgb .section}

If you have specific development requirements that cannot be met by the provided SDK, you can develop your own SDK based on the Alink protocol. For more information, see [Alink protocol](reseller.en-US/Developer Guide (Devices)/Develop devices based on Alink Protocol/Communications over Alink protocol.md#).

## Generic protocol SDK {#section_czd_vn1_mgb .section}

You can use the [generic protocol SDK](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Generic protocol SDK/Overview.md#) provided by IoT Platform to build a bridge to connect your devices or platforms with IoT Platform, so that they can communicate with each other.
