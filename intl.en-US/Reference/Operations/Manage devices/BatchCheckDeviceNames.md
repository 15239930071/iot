# BatchCheckDeviceNames {#reference_xct_2rz_wdb .reference}

Use this operation to customize multiple device names in a specified product. IoT Platform checks the validity of these names.

## Restrictions {#section_osp_szm_xdb .section}

This operation needs to be used with the BatchRegisterDeviceWithApplyId operation to register and name multiple devices. You can customize up to 1,000 device names using this API.

You must first call BatchCheckDeviceNames to specify the device names that you want to create. IoT Platform checks the validity of the device names you submitted, and then responds with an application ID \(ApplyId\). Use ApplyId and call BatchRegisterDeviceWithApplyId to register multiple devices. If the device name list contains an invalid device name, then the device application process fails. You can call QueryBatchRegisterDeviceStatus to check the application status. The returned result lists the invalid device names.

Call BatchRegisterDevice if you want to register multiple devices under the same product without naming them. The system automatically generates the names.

Call RegisterDevice if you want to register one device under a product.
