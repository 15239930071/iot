# RegisterDevice {#reference_pc2_kpz_wdb .reference}

You can call this operation to register a device under the specified product.

## Descriptions: {#section_r5z_4wf_xdb .section}

Registering a device creates a device under the product. After a device is successfully registered under the specified product, Alibaba Cloud IoT Platform issues a GUID \(IotId\) for the device. When you operate a device, you need to provide its unique IotId.

**Note:** Except for the IotId, you can also identify a device using the combination of the ProductKey and DeviceName. The ProductKey is the identifier that IoT Platform issues for a product when it is created, and the DeviceName is the device name that either you specified or the system randomly generated when the device was registered. The priority of IotId is higher than the combination of the ProductKey and DeviceName.

-   If you want to register multiple devices under a product at a time and have the device names randomly generated, you can call the BatchRegisterDevice operation. See [BatchRegisterDevice](intl.en-US/Reference/Operations/Manage devices/BatchRegisterDevice.md#)
-   If you want to register multiple devices under a product at a time and want to specify the name for each device, you need to call BatchCheckDeviceNames and BatchRegisterDeviceWithApplyId operations in order. See [BatchCheckDeviceNames](intl.en-US/Reference/Operations/Manage devices/BatchCheckDeviceNames.md#) and [BatchRegisterDeviceWithApplyId](intl.en-US/Reference/Operations/Manage devices/BatchRegisterDeviceWithApplyId.md#).

## Request parameters {#section_fkk_fyf_xdb .section}

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|:---|:---|:-------|:----------|
|Action|String|Yes|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to: RegisterDevice.|
|ProductKey|String|Yes|The identifier of the product for which you want to register devices.|
|DeviceName|String|No| The name of the device that you want to register. The device name should contain 4-32 characters, including English letters, numbers, and special characters, for example, hyphens \(-\), underscores \(\_\), at signs \(@\), periods \(.\) , and colons \(:\).

 The DeviceName is typically used in conjunction with the ProductKey  to identify a specified device.

 **Note:** If the specified parameter is not set, the device names will be randomly generated.
