**IoT Platform Basic**

-   Description: IoT Platform Basic provides secure and reliable connectivity between several hundred million devices along with basic device management and firmware upgrade capabilities. The Basic Edition also supports data streaming using the rule engine. The Basic Edition does not support data parsing or data storage. If you need other Alibaba Cloud services such as storage services and Message Service, you will need to purchase these services separately.
-   Scenario: The Basic Edition is suitable for developers who have well-developed hardware and software resources, and want to build business systems by flexibly combining Alibaba Cloud services.

**IoT Platform Pro**

-   Description: In addition to all the features included with IoT Platform Basic, IoT Platform Pro also supports the Alink protocol, device model definition, data parsing, online debugging, and remote management. The Pro Edition also provides comprehensive lifecycle management, data storage, real-time device running status, and historical device data.
-   The Pro Edition is ideal for developers who have a short development timeline for smart devices that deliver actionable intelligence. The Pro Edition is also ideal for solving issues concerning device data formats and storage. It is the best option when establishing vertical business systems, or when a fast approach to digital transformation is required.
